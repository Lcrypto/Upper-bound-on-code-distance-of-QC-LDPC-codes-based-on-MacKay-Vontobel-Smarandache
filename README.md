# Upper-bound-on-code-distance-of-QC-LDPC-codes-based-on-MacKay-Vontobel-Smarandache
The GitHub repository contains an upper bound on the code distance of QC-LDPC codes based on MacKay-Vontobel-Smarandache using the parity-check matrix of QC-LDPC codes. This implementation also supports circulant permutation matrices (CPMs) of QC-LDPC codes with weight more than 1.

The computation of the code distance is crucial for designing efficient error-correcting codes that can recover from errors introduced during communication. By providing an estimation of the upper bound on the code distance, this implementation allows researchers and practitioners to optimize their coding schemes to achieve better error-correction performance.

This implementation is based on well-regarded research, including the work by D. J. MacKay and M. C. Davey, "Evaluation of Gallager codes for short block length and high rate applications," R. Smarandache and P. O. Vontobel, "Quasi-cyclic LDPC codes: Influence of proto- and Tanner-graph structure on minimum Hamming distance upper bounds," and Brian K. Butler and Paul H. Siegel's "Bounds on the Minimum Distance of Punctured Quasi-Cyclic LDPC Codes."

Fast estimation of permanent source codes in both C and MATLAB can also be found on Dr. Brian K. Butler's website: https://sites.google.com/site/brianbutlerengineer/home/research

Overall, this repository offers a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in optimizing their coding schemes to achieve better error-correction performance. With its support for CPMs and fast estimation of permanent source codes, researchers and practitioners will find this implementation valuable in exploring various strategies for designing efficient error-correcting codes with high-performance rates.
